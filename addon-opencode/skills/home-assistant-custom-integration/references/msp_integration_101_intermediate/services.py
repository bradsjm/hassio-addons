"""Global services file.

This needs to be viewed with the services.yaml file
to demonstrate the different setup for using these services in the UI

IMPORTANT NOTES:
To ensure your service runs on the event loop, either make service function async
or decorate with @callback.  However, ensure that your function is non blocking or,
if it is, run in the executor.
Both examples are shown here.  Running services on different threads can cause issues.
